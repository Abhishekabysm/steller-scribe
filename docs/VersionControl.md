# Version Control Feature

## Overview

The Version Control feature in Stellar Scribe allows you to track changes to your notes over time and restore previous versions when needed. This provides a safety net for your work and enables you to experiment with changes without losing your original content.

## Features

### Auto-Save
- **Automatic Versioning**: The system automatically creates versions every 30 seconds when you make changes
- **Smart Detection**: Only creates versions when there are meaningful changes (minimum 10 characters changed)
- **Background Operation**: Runs silently in the background without interrupting your workflow

### Manual Version Control
- **Save Version Button**: Click the save icon (üíæ) in the toolbar to manually create a version
- **Version History**: Access the full version history by clicking the clock icon (üïê) in the toolbar
- **Change Descriptions**: Each version includes an automatic description of what changed

### Version Management
- **View All Versions**: Browse through all saved versions with timestamps and change descriptions
- **Compare Versions**: Select two versions to compare their differences side-by-side
- **Restore Versions**: Restore any previous version with a single click
- **Delete Versions**: Remove unwanted versions to save storage space

### Storage Management
- **Automatic Cleanup**: Old versions are automatically managed to prevent excessive storage use
- **Storage Monitoring**: View total storage usage and version count
- **Manual Cleanup**: Option to manually clean up old versions

## Technical Details

### Storage
- Versions are stored locally in your browser's localStorage
- Each note can have up to 50 versions
- Automatic cleanup removes old versions when the limit is reached
- Storage usage is displayed in the version history modal

### Version Types
- **Auto**: Automatically created every 30 seconds when changes are detected
- **Manual**: Created when you click the save button
- **Restore**: Created when you restore a previous version

### Change Detection
- Tracks line additions, deletions, and character changes

- Provides descriptive summaries of what changed

## Keyboard Shortcuts

## Best Practices

1. **Regular Manual Saves**: Create manual versions before making major changes
2. **Descriptive Versions**: The system automatically describes changes, but you can add custom descriptions
3. **Storage Management**: Periodically clean up old versions to maintain performance
4. **Version Comparison**: Use the compare feature to understand what changed between versions

## Troubleshooting

### Versions Not Saving
- Check if auto-save is enabled
- Ensure you're making meaningful changes (at least 10 characters)
- Check browser storage limits

### Can't Restore Versions
- Ensure the version exists in the history
- Check if the note is currently active
- Try refreshing the page if issues persist

### Storage Issues
- Use the cleanup feature to remove old versions
- Check browser storage settings
- Consider exporting important versions before cleanup

## Future Enhancements

- Cloud sync for versions
- Branching and merging capabilities
