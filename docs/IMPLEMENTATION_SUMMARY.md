## üé® Design Decisions

### 1. LocalStorage First
**Decision:** Implement with localStorage, Supabase optional

**Rationale:**
- Works immediately without setup
- No external dependencies
- Easy migration path
- Maintains offline-first philosophy

### 2. Flat Hierarchy
**Decision:** Single-level projects (no nesting)

**Rationale:**
- Simpler UI/UX
- Easier to understand
- Faster implementation
- Can add nesting later if needed

### 3. Color Palette
**Decision:** Fixed 12-color palette

**Rationale:**
- Visually distinct
- Accessible combinations
- Consistent branding
- Prevents color chaos

### 4. Emoji Icons
**Decision:** Emoji instead of icon library

**Rationale:**
- No additional dependencies
- Universal support
- Fun and expressive
- Zero bundle size impact

### 5. Smart Deletion
**Decision:** Multiple deletion strategies

**Rationale:**
- Prevents accidental data loss
- Flexibility for different use cases
- Clear user control
- Undo-friendly

### 6. Auto-Migration
**Decision:** One-time automatic migration

**Rationale:**
- Seamless upgrade experience
- No manual work required
- Backward compatible
- Can be disabled if needed

## üîß Technical Highlights

### Performance Optimizations
- `useMemo` for filtered notes (prevents re-filtering on every render)
- `useCallback` for all handlers (prevents re-creation)

- Virtual scrolling ready (infrastructure in place)

### Type Safety
- 100% TypeScript coverage
- Strict type checking enabled
- No `any` types (except controlled cases)

- Graceful degradation
- User-friendly error messages
- Console logging for debugging

## üêõ Known Limitations

1. **Single-Level Hierarchy**
   - No nested projects yet
   - Can be added in future version

2. **No Multi-Select**
   - Must drag notes one at a time
   - Infrastructure ready for multi-select

3. **No Undo for Project Operations**
   - Deletion is final (except notes can be moved)
   - Toast notifications help awareness

4. **LocalStorage Limits**
   - ~5MB storage limit in most browsers
   - Supabase sync solves this

5. **No Project Sharing**
   - Projects are local/per-user
   - Sharing feature planned for future
